#+TITLE: Static Site Generator with Emacs and Org Mode

* Overview
This project is a personal static site generator built entirely within Emacs using its powerful Org Mode export engine (~ox-publish~). It takes a collection of Org files, processes them, and generates a static HTML website, including a blog, static pages, and assets.

The system is designed to be:
- *Content-driven*: The focus is on writing content in simple Org files.
- *Customizable*: The build process is defined in an Emacs Lisp script, allowing for deep customization of the final HTML output.
- *Selective*: Only Org files explicitly marked for publishing are included in the final site.
- *Self-contained*: It uses a local package directory to manage Emacs package dependencies.

* How it Works
The build process is orchestrated by a simple shell script (`build.sh` or similar) that uses Emacs in a non-interactive (batch) mode.

1.  *Tangle (Optional but good practice)*: The shell script's first command, `emacs --batch ... (org-babel-tangle-file ...)` is designed to extract Emacs Lisp code from an Org file (e.g., `build.org`). This practice, called "tangling," allows you to keep your configuration documented within a literate programming environment. The output is a pure script file, `build.el`.
2.  *Execute Build Script*: The second command, `emacs -Q --script build.el`, runs the generated Emacs Lisp script.
    - `-Q`: Starts Emacs with minimal configuration, ensuring a clean and predictable environment.
    - `--script build.el`: Executes the script non-interactively and then exits.
3.  *Publish Content*: The `build.el` script configures and runs Org's `ox-publish` system, which reads the source files (`.org`, `.css`, etc.), converts them to HTML, and places the final site in the `./public/` directory.

* Code Breakdown
** The Build Script (e.g., `build.sh`)
This is the entry point for the entire build process.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
#!/usr/bin/env sh

# Step 1: Tangle the Org file
# Extracts Lisp code from `posts/build.org` into `build.el`.
emacs --batch --eval "(require 'org)" --eval "(org-babel-tangle-file \"posts/build.org\")"

# Step 2: Run the tangled Emacs Lisp script
# Executes the build logic using a clean Emacs instance.
emacs -Q --script build.el
#+END_SRC

** The Emacs Lisp Configuration (`build.el`)
This file contains all the logic for setting up the environment and defining the publishing rules.

*** 1. Package Management
The script first sets up a local Emacs package environment to ensure dependencies are met without affecting the user's global Emacs configuration.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'package)
;; Use a local directory for packages
(setq package-user-dir (expand-file-name "./.packages"))
;; Define package sources (MELPA and ELPA)
(setq package-archives '(("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
                         ("elpa" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")))

(package-initialize)
;; Refresh package list if not already done
(unless package-archive-contents
  (package-refresh-contents))

;; Install the `htmlize` package, used for syntax highlighting in code blocks
(package-install 'htmlize)
#+END_SRC

*** 2. HTML Export Customization
This section customizes the HTML output to meet specific needs, like using a custom stylesheet and integrating the Prism.js syntax highlighter.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Required for the publishing logic
(require 'ox-publish)

;; Define the HTML head content, linking to custom CSS and JS for Prism
(setq set-css "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"/asset/css/style.css\"/><link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/asset/css/prism.css\"/><script src=\"/asset/js/prism.js\"></script>")

;; This function REPLACES the default source code block exporter.
;; It generates HTML compatible with Prism.js: `<pre><code class="language-xyz">...`
(defun my/org-html-src-block (src-block _contents info)
  "Transcode a SRC-BLOCK element from Org to HTML for Prism.js."
  (if (org-export-read-attribute :attr_html src-block :textarea)
      (org-html--textarea-block src-block)
    (let* ((lang (org-element-property :language src-block))
           (code (org-html-format-code src-block info)))
      ;; ... (caption logic remains the same)
      ;; The key change is here:
      (format "<pre><code class=\"src language-%s\"%s>%s</code></pre>"
              lang "" code)))) ; Simplified for clarity

;; Define a new export backend named `site-html` based on the default `html` backend.
;; This new backend uses our custom function for source blocks.
(org-export-define-derived-backend 'site-html 'html
  :translate-alist
  '((src-block . my/org-html-src-block)))

;; Global HTML export settings
(setq org-html-validation-link nil ; Remove W3C validation link
      org-html-head-include-scripts nil ; Don't include default JS
      org-html-head-include-default-style nil ; Don't include default CSS
      org-html-head set-css) ; Use our custom head content
#+END_SRC

*** 3. Publishing Logic
This is the core of the static site generator. It defines which files to publish, where to find them, and where to put the output.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; A custom publishing function to filter files.
;; It only publishes an Org file if it contains the line: `#+SELECT_TAGS: publish`
(defun my/org-publish (plist filename pub-dir)
  "Publish the file only if it contains '#+SELECT_TAGS: publish'."
  (org-publish-org-to 'site-html filename ; Use our custom 'site-html' backend
                      (concat ... ".html")
                      plist pub-dir))

;; The main configuration for the entire project
(setq org-publish-project-alist
      (list

       ;; Component 1: "posts"
       ;; Publishes blog posts from the ./posts directory
       (list "posts"
             :base-directory "./posts"
             :publishing-directory "./public/posts"
             :publishing-function 'my/org-publish ; Use our custom filter function
             :recursive nil
             :auto-sitemap t ; Automatically generate a sitemap
             :sitemap-title "posts"
             :sitemap-filename "posts.org"
             :with-toc t)

       ;; Component 2: "pages"
       ;; Publishes top-level pages from the root directory
       (list "pages"
             :base-directory "./"
             :publishing-directory "./public/"
             :publishing-function 'my/org-publish ; Also uses the filter
             :exclude "README.org" ; Don't publish the README
             :recursive nil
             :with-toc t)

       ;; Component 3: "static"
       ;; Copies static assets (CSS, JS, images) as-is
       (list "static"
         :base-directory "./"
         :base-extension "css\\|txt\\|jpg\\|gif\\|png\\|js"
         :recursive t
         :publishing-directory  "./public"
         ;; Uses the standard function for copying attachments
         :publishing-function 'org-publish-attachment)

       ;; Component 4: "site"
       ;; A meta-component that groups the others for easy publishing
       (list "site" :components (list "pages" "static" "posts"))
))
#+END_SRC

*** 4. Triggering the Publish
This final line executes the entire process defined in `org-publish-project-alist`.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Publish the "site" component, which includes all other components.
;; The `t` argument forces republishing of all files, ignoring timestamps.
(org-publish-all t)
#+END_SRC

** The Main Org File (`index.org`)
This is an example of a source content file. It demonstrates several key features of Org Mode for web publishing.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
;; --- METADATA ---
#+TITLE: Hamza Hamud
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil  ; Disables the table of contents for this page

;; --- INCLUDES ---
;; Includes the raw HTML content from another file at the top of the body
#+INCLUDE: "./html-templates/preample.html" export html

;; --- CUSTOM CSS ---
;; Injects page-specific CSS to hide the main title generated by Org Mode
#+HTML_HEAD_EXTRA: <style type="text/css">
#+HTML_HEAD_EXTRA: .title { display: none; }
#+HTML_HEAD_EXTRA: </style>


;; --- CONTENT ---
* About Me
Hi! I'm Hamza...

* Posts
;; Includes the content from another Org file, starting from line 3.
;; This is likely used to embed the generated post sitemap.
#+INCLUDE: "./posts/posts.org" :lines "3-"

** Current Projects

#+END_SRC

* How to Use
1.  *Prerequisites*: You need a working installation of Emacs.
2.  *Content Creation*:
    - Create `.org` files for your pages (in `./`) or posts (in `./posts/`).
    - **Crucially**, add the line `#+SELECT_TAGS: publish` to any `.org` file you want to be published on the site.
    - Add static assets like CSS, JS, and images to their respective directories (e.g., `./asset/css/`).
3.  *Build the Site*: Run the build script from your terminal:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    sh build.sh
    #+END_SRC
4.  *View the Output*: The complete, generated website will be in the `./public/` directory. You can open `public/index.html` in a browser to see the result.
